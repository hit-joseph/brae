Bilingual contrained phrase embedding for MT

Monolingual phrase embedding works with backpropagation

$ time ./phraseEmbedding.py
Reading vectors in binary format
Read 555587 entries from the binary file
Embedding shape = (50,)

This experiment had 
\alpha (Learning rate) = 0.01
\lambda (Regularization parameter) = 0.1
10 iterations of batch backpropagation were performed

TODO:
2. There seem to be some -1s in the input vectors, where are these coming from ? 
3. Create a class for phraseEmbedding
4. Do this for two languages
5. Run this for multiple settings of n, \lambda and \alpha
6. Implement fine-tuning (BRAE) mechanism
